# ENSF-381-B01-Lab-07
Welcome to the ENSF381 course lab! In this lab, we will build on what we have
learned in React by designing a Tic-Tac-Toe game. This lab will help reinforce key
concepts like component structure, state management, and event handling while
giving you hands-on experience with Reactâ€™s core principles.
